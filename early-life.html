            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South
            Africa. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and
            dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa.
            His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical
            engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer. Musk
            has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister,
            Tosca (born 1974). His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an
            American-born Canadian, and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
            ancestry. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with
            his father in Pretoria and elsewhere, a choice he made two years
            after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become
            estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human
            being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has
            done." He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.

            Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video
            games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer
            programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a
            BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office
            Technology magazine for approximately $500. An awkward and
            introverted child, Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was
            once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of
            stairs. He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and
            Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High
            School.

            Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,
            Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born
            mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University
            of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory
            service in the South African military. Musk arrived in Canada in
            June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan for a
            year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, Musk
            entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he
            transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997
            with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of
            Arts degree in physics.

            In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the
            summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which
            researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at
            the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, Musk was
            accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials
            science at Stanford University in California.[34] Musk attempted to
            get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his
            inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding
            instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.
